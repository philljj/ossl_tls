About:
  This is a toy OpenSSL TLS client/server implementation.
  This was written using OpenSSL 1.0.2o
  This is for fun and education.
  This is not production ready TLS with OpenSSL 1.1.1

Setup:
  1. run configure script
  2. run build script
  3. drink espresso
  4. that's it

Notes:
  This requires TLS_CA_FILE, TLS_KEY_FILE env vars are set.
  Source this file "scripts/set_run_env" to set env.

  Use scripts to do little tests, such as:
    $ ./scripts/test_ciphers `hostname` 7777 | grep worked
    info: cipher AES256-GCM-SHA384 worked
    info: cipher AES128-GCM-SHA256 worked
    info: cipher AES256-SHA256 worked
    info: cipher AES128-SHA256 worked
    info: cipher AES256-SHA worked
    info: cipher CAMELLIA256-SHA worked
    info: cipher AES128-SHA worked
    info: cipher CAMELLIA128-SHA worked

  and:
    $ ./scripts/test_protos `hostname` 7777
    trying ssl3
    info: proto ssl3 failed
    trying tls1
    info: proto tls1 failed
    trying tls1_1
    info: proto tls1_1 failed
    trying tls1_2
    info: proto tls1_2 worked
